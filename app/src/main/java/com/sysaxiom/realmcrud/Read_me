Steps for using Realm Kotlin

Installation:

Step 1: Add the class path dependency to build.gradle

Inside dependencies:
    classpath "io.realm:realm-gradle-plugin:6.0.1"

Step 2: Apply the realm-android plugin to the top of the application level build.gradle file.

    apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'
    apply plugin: 'realm-android'

###OBSERVATIONS
1. User Id Should be auto increment
2. Lets try to achieve Single File Concept (Like Class in Single File)
3. Possibility to Read Array like this
    This should be dynamic like
        This is too complicated, we can do in future - getRecord('sorttype','records');
        This is okay i feel, getRecord(100); -> It will bring old 100 (records)
4. Possibility to Delete array of data like (Delete 1 to 60 Records) or Delete [1,2,3,9,10]
